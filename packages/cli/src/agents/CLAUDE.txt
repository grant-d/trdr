Agents are adaptive (no manual dials)

TODO:
1) implement all agents, integrate into run-demo
2) add unit tests for ALL agents, ensure high coverage
3) fix ALL units
4) typecheck
5) optimize code in ALL agents, ensure doc-comments, use common patterns, share code, avoid `any`
6) deferred: allow laddering & DCA (self tuning based on risk/reward)
7) repeat until all agents are implemented and working and ALL tests pass with NO lint issues
8) done: Check sharpe calculation, it seems to always be 0

9) Try beat sharpe -1.37, sortino -1.10, roi -170% for `yarn demo --verbose --adaptive --liquidate ./csv/BTCUSD-feed.csv -s BTC`

10) deferred: An agent that uses matrix profile (ie a cheap version of stumpy)
11) deferred: An agent that uses prime numbers, riemann, golden ratio, fib, etc
